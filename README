Pololu-3Pi-Stuff
================

This folder contains some programs I've made for the Pololu 3Pi robot.
Most of it will probably be just basic stuff, but who knows.

Setup
-----
-   Since I only have Sparkfun's AVR Pocket Programmer, 
    which doesn't work with Atmel Studio, I work with avrdude.
-   The Pololu-3Pi-Stuff folder is located in libpololu-avr folder, 
    whereever you install it.
-   The makefiles are written for unix system, if you want to use 
    them on windows, you need to replace the path separator from / to \.
-   To install the AVR programming and pololu environment on linux, 
    you may use the script linux-env-setup.sh. ("sudo sh linux-env-setup.sh")
    It was written and tested only on ubuntu 12.04 and updated for 12-25-2012, 
    so when a new version of libpololu-avr will be out, it should be updated.

Current programs
----------------

- Point collector:
	Line follower that stops in X (1-10) "points". TBD: upload a picture of a sample course
	Uses: IR sensors, LEDs, LCD, motors, buzzer.
- Maze solver:
    A program to solve mazes, based on pololus program
- Musician:
    Not ready, play music according to the line it is over
- Barcode reader:
    One day it will read an EAN 13 barcode, right now it just gets a number and converts it to the barcode version.
