++ Pololu-3Pi-Stuff ++


This folder contains programs I've made for the Pololu 3Pi robot.
Most of it will probably be just basic stuff, but who knows.

Setup:
- As I only have Sparkfun's AVR Pocket Programmer, which doesn't work with Atmel Studio, I work with avrdude.
- The Pololu-3Pi-Stuff folder is located in libpololu-avr folder, where ever you install it.
- The makefile for each projects is based on my setup, so you'll probably need to change it if you want to compile the program.

Current programs
----------------

- Point collector:
	Line follower that stops in X (1-10) "points". TBD: upload a picture of a sample course
	Uses: IR sensors, LEDs, LCD, motors, buzzer.
