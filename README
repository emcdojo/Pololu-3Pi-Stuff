Pololu-3Pi-Stuff
----------------

This folder contains programs I've made for the Pololu 3Pi robot.
Most of it will probably be just basic stuff, but who knows.

- Setup:
	As I only have Sparkfun's AVR Pocket Programmer, which doesn't work with Atmel Studio, I work with avrdude
	
- Makefile:
	The makefile for each projects is based on my setup, so you'll probably need to change it if you want to compile the program.
